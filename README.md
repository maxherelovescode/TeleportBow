A bow that teleports you places
## How to build
Get Intellj idea.
<br>Press wacko run button
## How to use
If you dont know how to add a plugin how do you know what one is?
### No But Seriously
I would recommend using a paper server because it is best. <br>
DO NOT use a Bukkit server It will NOT work. If anything use a spigot server. <br>
But i would 100% recommend paper <br>

### Why Thank You!
Its up to you but I personally would fork the dev branch allthough that branch is probaby going to be ass because its not working. If you want to use a 100% working version use the main branch. Pretty self explanitory. Main works and dev in in development. Allthough the dev branch won't have all bugs fixed so you might have to fix my shit to make yours <br> Then if you feel like your thing is good create a pull request and I might add it. I WILL CREDIT YOU! Because I am nice and not a jerk. If you do contribute thats very nice and thank you
